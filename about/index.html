    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>We present a tool for helping installation artists with the creation of interactive and appealing night light installations. We targeted the problem of visualising animated lighting sequences and placing sensors on the installation. Our tool allows the artist to load in their preliminary phyical designs and simulate crowd movements around the installation. Following that, they can see the installation from different viewpoints and also load in the animated lighting sequences. As large-scale light installations have a long construction time, the tool will enable many iterations of testing before the physical structures are even built.</p>
