    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>We present a tool for helping installation artists with the creation of interactive and appealing night light installations. We targeted the problem of visualising animated lighting sequences and placing sensors on the installation. Our tool allows the artist to load in their preliminary phyical designs and simulate crowd movements around the installation. Following that, they can see the installation from different viewpoints and also load in the animated lighting sequences. As large-scale light installations have a long construction time, the tool will enable many iterations of testing before the physical structures are even built.</p>

    <h2>Features</h2>
    <h3>Crowd Simulation</h3>
    <p>To aid the artist with visualising their installation in the context of their site, we simulate crowds navigating around the installation. The simulation serves multiple purposes:
      <ul>
        <li>Highlight potential choke points around the structure,</li>
        <li>Visualise the lighting sequence reacting to the crowd,</li>
        <li>Identify suitable positions to place sensors or cameras on the structure</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>After loading in their physical design, a navigation mesh is generated based on the object. Navigation meshes are used by the agents in the crowd simulation for pathfinding around the structure, as shortest-path or least-effort algorithms rarely generate paths that approach closed convex spaces of the installation.
    </p>
    <h3>Light Placement and Patterns</h3>
    <p>We assume that the light installation will be lit with individually addressable RGB LED strips placed along the structure. This is currently the most versatile way as it allows precice colour and spatial control. To do this, we used the <a href="http://paulbourke.net/papers/conrec/">CONREC algorithm</a> to place lights at regular intervals along the surface of the strucutre. After placing the lights, we programmatically changed their colours based on their position.
    </p>
    <h3>Camera Controls</h3>
    <p>To allow a good sense of what the installation would look like after it is completed, and to observe the different behaviours and patterns of the installation or crowd, a few different camera views were created. These include the top view, free view, human view and structure view.
